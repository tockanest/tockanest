## 🌟 About Us

Tocka Nest is an initiative dedicated to fostering open-source solutions 🌐, particularly aimed at benefiting Brazilian companies 🇧🇷 that lack the resources to develop proprietary internal systems.

Our mission is to share the complete source code for various in-development internal systems 📦, providing an alternative to costly commercial products that may not always deliver on quality 💸. We understand the challenges faced by companies in this space, as we've experienced them firsthand. Our offerings include:

- [🔢 Sistemas de Pontos](#)
- [💰 Sistema de Caixa](#)
- [📄 Sistema de Emissão de NFE e CFE](#)
- [👥 Aplicativos Para Gerenciamento de Funcionários](#)

While we strive for perfection, we acknowledge our limitations and embrace the journey of continuous improvement 🔄, much like any entity dedicated to the open-source ethos. It's important to note that not all our projects will be open-sourced; a list of proprietary projects can be found at [Not Open Source](#not-open-source).
